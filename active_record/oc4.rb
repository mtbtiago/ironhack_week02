# OC4. IronhackLIST

# Oh, man. We are so proud of our Student class. Validated, short, compact. Is it love?

# Anyway, the thing you probably missed from SL12 is having some web in between. Some routes, some Sinatra, some ERB… so let’s do it, why
# not?

# You will now implement a Ironhack directory of students, that shows a list of everyone’s name, surname, birthday, a clickable link to
# their website, if they have programming experience or not (Yes/No) and, more importantly, ¡the number of dogs they have!

# Apart from that, you should be able to create new students through the interface, and also delete the ones which have 0 dogs (we cannot
# kick the others out, they have dogs!).

# Go for it!
